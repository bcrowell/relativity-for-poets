\section{No action at a distance}

The Newtonian picture of the universe has particles interacting with each other by exerting
forces from a distance, and these forces are imagined to occur without any time
delay. But as we've seen, relativity forbids this. The universal speed $c$ is the maximum
speed at which cause and effect can propagate. This blanket prohibition applies to any
force at all. In Star Wars, Obi Wan Kenobi senses the destruction of the planet Alderaan and
says, ``I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly
cried out in terror, and were suddenly silenced.'' No matter what kind of force ``the
Force'' is, this is impossible. The planet is light-years away, so any information about
its destruction can only arrive after a time delay of years.

\section{Fields}

Since forces can't be transmitted instantaneously, it becomes natural to imagine force-effects
spreading outward from their source like ripples on a pond, and we then have no choice but to
impute some physical reality to these ripples. We call them fields, and they have their own
independent existence. Gravity is transmitted through the gravitational field.
Besides gravity, there are other fundamental fields of force such as electricity and magnetism.
Ripples of the electricity and magnetism are light waves.

Even empty space, then, is not perfectly featureless. It has measurable
properties. This concept made a deep impression
on Einstein as a child. He recalled that
as a five-year-old, the gift of a magnetic compass convinced him that there was ``something behind 
things, something deeply hidden.''

The smoking-gun argument for this strange notion of
traveling force ripples comes from the fact that they carry energy. In figure 1,
Alice and Betty hold  magnets
A and B at some distance from one another. If Alice chooses to move
her magnet father from Betty's, as in figure 2, Alice will have to expend some energy
to fight against the magnetic force, burning off some of the calories from that
chocolate cheesecake she had at lunch.

<% fig("field-energy-argument","!htpb") %>

But now suppose, as shown in figure 3, that Betty decides to play a trick on Alice
by tossing magnet B far away just as Alice is getting ready to move magnet A.
We have already established that Alice can't feel magnet B's motion instantaneously, so the magnetic forces
must actually be propagated by a magnetic \emph{field}. Of course this experiment is
utterly impractical, but suppose for the sake of argument that the time it takes the change in the magnetic field
to propagate across the diagram is long enough so that Alice can complete her motion before she feels the
effect of B's disappearance. She is still getting stale information about B's position. As she moves A to the
left, she feels resistance, because the field in her region of space is still the field caused by
B in its \emph{old} position. She has burned some chocolate cheesecake calories, and it appears that
conservation of energy has been violated, because these calories can't be properly accounted for
by any interaction with B, which is long gone.

If we hope to preserve the law of conservation of energy, then the only possible conclusion is that
the magnetic field itself carries away the cheesecake energy. In fact, this example
represents an impractical method of transmitting radio waves. Alice burns calories by moving magnet A, and that energy
goes into the radio waves. Even if B had never existed, the radio waves would still have carried energy,
and Alice would still have had to do work in order to create them.

Although I referred to magnets in this argument, I never appealed to any properties of the magnetic force,
so it follows that force-ripples in \emph{any} field carry energy.
For example, suppose that super-powerful aliens, angered by the advent of disco
music, come to our solar system on a mission to
cleanse the universe of our aesthetic contamination. They apply a force to our
sun, causing it to go flying out of the solar system at a gazillion miles an hour.

Newton expects the gravitational force of the sun on
the earth to \emph{immediately} start dropping off, and
and since sunlight takes eight minutes to get from the sun to the earth, the change in gravitational force
would be the first way in which earthlings learn the bad news --- the sun would not
visibly start receding until a little later.

Newton is wrong. Both effects would travel at $c$, and they would be detected simultaneously on earth.

\section{Electromagnetic waves}\label{sec:em-waves}

``And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.''
Light is pretty important to us, as implied by this passage's prominent placement in
the creation myth. Light is a vibration of the electric and magnetic fields, and to make
sense out of that statement, you need to have at least some idea of what electric and magnetic fields are.
The operationalist philosophy (section \ref{sec:operationalism}, p.~\pageref{sec:operationalism}) is that
this means knowing how to measure them. A magnetic compass measures the direction of the magnetic field.
A crude method of measuring an electric field is to rub a balloon against your hair in order to put
some electric charge on it, and then release the balloon; any ambient electric field will cause the balloon
to accelerate in a certain direction, which is the direction of the field. 

Although physicists didn't realize
it until late in the game, it turns out that electric and magnetic fields are very closely related.
If an observer in frame of reference A detects only an electric field, an observer in frame B, moving relative to A,
sees a mixture of magnetic and electric fields. Similarly, a field that is purely magnetic in one frame
is a mixture in another frame. For related reasons, a changing electric field creates ---
or ``induces'' --- a magnetic
field, and vice versa. This is the principle behind devices such as generators and transformers.

<% fig("em-wave","!htpb") %>

Vibrations in these fields will be emitted by any electric charge that shakes back and forth.
For example, in a candle flame, the high temperature indicates rapid vibration of the atoms and charged subatomic particles
in the flames. When you transmit radio waves from the radio antenna hidden inside your cell phone,
electrons are wiggling back and forth between the ends of a hidden antenna.

Because of this close relationship between the two fields, any vibration of the electric field produces a
vibration of the magnetic field, and vice versa. Therefore there are no purely electric or purely magnetic
waves. As shown in the diagram, the waves are structured so that the fields vibrate in directions that are
perpendicular both to each other and to the direction in which the wave is moving.
Unlike sound waves and water waves, electromagnetic waves are not vibrations of any physical medium.

A wave has a wavelength, which is the distance from one crest to the next, and a frequency, which is the number
of wave crests that pass over a certain position in one unit of time. A higher frequency means a shorter wavelength.
Visible light is an electromagnetic wave that has a frequency within a certain range, with the blue and red ends of
the rainbow differing by about a factor of two. Visible light is only one small segment of the vast electromagnetic
spectrum, which includes such superficially disparate phenomena as radio waves and x-rays.

Electromagnetic waves carry energy, as you can tell when you use a microwave oven to heat your food.

\section{Gravitational waves}

The equivalence principle tells us that the gravitational field can, at least locally, be considered to be
an illusion: for a free-falling observer, there is no field. This suggests the possibility that waves in
the gravitational field might also be illusions. In fact, Einstein tried to publish a paper in 1936 making
exactly this claim. The paper was wrong, and was rejected based on the report of the Physical Review's
anonymous referee. (Einstein held a grudge, and never submitted another paper to that journal.) In nontechnical
language, the important point is that although \emph{locally} we can always consider a gravitational field to be
fictitious, that doesn't hold on larger scales. On larger scales, we can have tidal forces
(section \ref{sec:tidal}, p.~\pageref{sec:tidal}), which are objectively real; for example, they can cause water
to rise higher on a beach.

<% fig("gravitational-wave","!htpb") %>

The figure shows what would happen if a strong enough gravitational wave passed through Albert Einstein's head.
The effect is to alternately squish and stretch him along two axes perpendicular to the direction in which the
wave is moving. Because Einstein's head isn't perfectly flexible, it resists these distortions, and the result is
frictional heating; just like electromagnetic waves, gravitational waves transport energy. A more realistic
way of detecting a gravitational wave is to replace Einstein's head with a kilometer-long vacuum tube, and monitor
any stretching or squishing of the tube using a laser; there is a ground-based
project called LIGO already in operation to try to 
do this, and a European Space Agency project to launch a space-based system called LISA.

There's good news and bad news about detecting gravitational waves.

First the good news. In order to produce strong gravitational waves, you need large masses (such as stars)
moving very violently (preferably at speeds close to the speed of light). This means that if astronomers can
detect gravitational waves coming from outer space, they can learn about rare awesomely apocalyptic processes, such
as the collision of two black holes. Also, gravitational waves do not interact very strongly with matter, so
the universe is essentially transparent to them. Our view of the universe through the gravitational-wave spectrum
would never be blocked by clouds of gas or dust, as is often the case with electromagnetic waves. In particular,
the very early universe (less than about 100,000 years after the big bang) was full of hot, ionized gas, which was
completely opaque to light, so gravitational waves are probably the only way we could ever hope to ``see'' the
early universe directly. Direct detection of any gravitational waves would also be a spectacular confirmation of
one of general relativity's most important predictions.

The bad news is the same as the good news. Processes violent enough to produce strong gravitational
waves are uncommon. If such events happen, they happen rarely and typically at vast distances from us.
The weak interaction of gravitational waves with matter also means that detectors made out of matter
are not very sensitive to them.
Therefore it's very difficult to get such a detector to work well enough to give a definite blip.

Luckily direct detection is not the only possible way to verify that
gravitational waves exist.  In 1974, Russell Hulse and Joseph Taylor
used the Arecibo radio telescope to discover a pair of neutron stars
(see p.~\pageref{neutron-star}) orbiting around each other once every
7.75 hours. They found that this orbital period was gradually shortening,
by about 68 nanoseconds with each revolution. Detailed analysis of the radio signals
allowed the stars' masses and orbits to be fully characterized.
Because these are large masses moving very violently, general
relativity predicts that they will radiate a huge amount of energy in
the form of gravitational waves ---  $7\times10^{24}$ watts, or
about a trillion times our world's total production of electrical
power.  Because of this loss of energy, the stars are predicted to be
gradually spiraling inward toward one another, resulting in a
quickening of their revolutions that matches the observed speed-up to
within a fraction of a percent. Because of the excellent agreement
with general relativity in this as well as other observations of the system,
physicists consider Hulse and Taylor's observations to be a very clearcut,
albeit indirect, confirmation of the existence of gravitational waves,
and the two physicists were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1993.
